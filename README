Solution written on PHP/MySQL, framework Yii 1.* (req PDO:MySQL)

Shorten algorithm - take md5 from original url, it will be 32 symbol hex, split it into 8 parts by 4 digits
convert hex 4digits to int digit and modulus result to len of alphabet, result digit will be index on alphabet array

If result 8 symbol string will be taken, it will add random number to the end of original url.

Configure your database setting protected/config/database.php , should be MySQL
cd protected
Change #!/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/bin/php in yiic file to your php path
./yiic migrate

Navigate to http://yourhostproject.local/

And create some urls

To clean urls created more then 15 days, launch and add to cron:
./yiic cleanurls
